# Exposure scenarios xlsx

The xlsx file contains five PFAS human exposure scenarios for all the expoure routes (i.e., ingestion, inhalation and dermal exposure). Each xlsx sheet is a different exposure scenatio starting with the exposure via food ingestion, exposure via drinking water (bottled or tap water) ingestion, exposure via dust ingestion, dermal exposure and exposure via dust inhalation. In the xlsx sheets each column referes to different parameter, categorizing the significant information of each study. These are:

* The PFAS chemical 
* The geographical area 
* The year of the study 
* The number of samples (In the case of food exposure the number of adults, in the case of drinking water the number of bottles, or the amount of water (in litters) and in the case of dust the cubic meters of the studied area or dimensions of the indoor space)
* The type of consumption (i.e., type of food, type of drinking water)
* Land use (agricultural, residential or industrial)
* The EDI values (Estimated Daily Intake) (in ng/kg of bw/day)
* The type of exposure (occupational or non-occupational)
* The exposure time (i.e., lifetime, during the experiment, or specific time)
* The PFAS concentration (i.e., in drinking water, food, blood serum) 

The PFAS chemicals which are contained in the xlsx for all the exposure scenarios are: PFBA, PFPeA, PFBS, PFHxA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFNA, PFOS, PFDS, PFHpA, PFHpS, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFUdA, PFDoA, PFDoDA, PFODA, PFHxDA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, 4:2FTS, 6:2 FTS, 8:2 FTS, HFPO-TrA, HFPO-TeA, PFMOAA, PFO2HxA, PFO3OA, PFO5DoA, PF4OPeA, 6:2Cl-PFESA, 8:2Cl-PFESA, H-PFMO2OSA, 6:2Cl-PFESA, THPFOS, PFPeS, FBSA, 6:2FTSA, 8:2FTSA, 6:2FTCA, 8:2FTCA, 8:2FTUCA, 6:2diPAP, 8:2diPAP, 6:2Cl-PFESA, 8:2Cl-PFESA, 6:2FTOH, 8:2FTOH, 10:2FTOH, 4:2FTSA, 6:2FTSA, 8:2FTSA, FOSA, 6:2FTOH, 8:FTOH, 10:2FTOH, MeFOSE, EtFOSE, 6:2monoPAP, 8:2monoPAP, 6:2diPAP, 8:2diPAP, C6/C6-PFPIA, C6/C8-PFPIA, C8/C8-PFPIA, C6-PFPA, C8-PFPA, C10-PFPA, MeP, EtP, PrP and BuP.

The food type is meat, eggs, fish, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy milk. The drinking water is either from bottles or tap water. The dust exposure is indoor and outdoor scenario.
