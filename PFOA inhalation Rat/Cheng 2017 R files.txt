Cheng 2017: literature code

Cheng 2017_2: with the protein binding expression of Cheng 2021

Cheng 2017_3:
with the protein binding expression of Cheng 2021 and linear passive diffusion/saturable process for transporters
deletion of cell-water concentration ratios, change of bGTGL <- kGLGT/(VGT * CRssG) to bGTGL <- kGLGT/VGT (likewise: bKTF,     bLTbile)

Cheng 2017_single_optimisation: file for optimising Cheng model based on a single dataset. In the future this code will
be extended to allow optimisation of parameters by fitting on multiple datasets 

Cheng 2017_single_optimisation - mass_p:
model with lungs, tested with Kudo et al., 2007 data, with good prediciton results AAFE ~ 1.75

Cheng 2017_single_optimisation - mass_p-2
add more CMTs in the model
