# PBK models for PFAS 
This repository contains R code for developing PBK model for describing PFAS biodistribution in multiple species and deploying as web services on Jaqpot (https://www.jaqpot.org/). This work is part of the SCENARIOS EU H2020 project (https://scenarios-project.eu/). The list of available PBK models will be updated throughout the lifespan of the project.

## List of PBK models
- Humans:
    * PFOS/PFOA (Loccisano et al., 2011)
    * PFAAs (Fabrega et al., 2015)
    * PFOS/PFOA (Fabrega et al., 2016)
- Rats:
    * PFOA [male, female] (Loccisano et al., 2012)
    * PFOS [male, female] (Loccisano et al., 2012)
    * PFHxS [male, female] (Kim et al., 2018)
    * PFNA [male, female] (Kim et al., 2019)
    * PFDA [male, female] (Kim et al., 2019)
- Fish:
   * PFOS Rainbow trout PBPK (Vidal et al., 2020)
   * PFAAs Protein Binding Fish PBK (Ng and Konrad Hungerbühler, 2013)

## Folder Contents
*  Bernstein et al.2021 --> This folder transfers the PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA and PFDA PBK code presented in Bernstein et al. (2021) to R code in an appropriate format, so that it can be readily exposed as a web service on Jaqpot.
*  Fabrega et al.2015 --> The file "PFAS_PBK_Fabrega_2015_Jaqpot_upload.R" consists of the model and can be used to upload the mon on Jaqpot as a web service.
*  Fabrega et al.2016 --> The file "PFOS_PFOA Human PBK.R" consists of the model and can be used to upload the mon on Jaqpot as a web service.
*  Ng and Hungerbühler 2013 --> The file "Ng_Hungerbuhler_2013.R" consists of the model and can be used to upload the mon on Jaqpot as a web service.
*  PFAS Rainbow trout PBK --> This folder contains the code of an under development PBK model. The purpose of the model is to predict the concentration of PFAAs substances in Rainbow trout after being dietary exposed.
*  Vidal et al.2019 --> The file "PFOS_Rainbow_trout_PBTK.R" contains the model written in R and the code to easily upload the model on Jaqpot.
*  Vidal et al.2020 --> The file "Jaqpot_final.R" contains the model written in R and the code to easily upload the model on Jaqpot.
## Necessary R packages
* `deSolve`  --> A library containing functions for solving ODE systems
* `jaqpotr` --> A library containing functions for uploading models on the Jaqpot server. Installation instructions can be found in https://www.jaqpot.org/docs/r
